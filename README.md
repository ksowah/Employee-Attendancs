# Employee-Attendancs
In some organizations, employees are required to write their names and the time they report to work every day. In some cases, late employees tend to change the actual time they arrive and write a different time which will cover their misconduct. This JAVA program allows users (employees) to only write their names after which the program attaches the date and exact time they arrived.
